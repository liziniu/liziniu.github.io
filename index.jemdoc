== About me

I am a Ph.D. student at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen (CUHKSZ), advised by [https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dW3gcXoAAAAJ&hl=en Prof. Zhi-Quan (Tom) Luo].

I am interested in artificial intelligence, especially reinforcement learning and large language models.

I have worked/interned at Tencent, Nanjing University, Cardinal Operations, etc.

My curriculum vitae can be downloaded from [docs/CV_Ziniu_Li.pdf here].

Feel free to contact me if you want to discuss some ideas.
